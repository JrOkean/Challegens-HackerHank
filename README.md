# Challegens-HackerHank
A place to store my HackerRank challenges simply because I feel more comfortable using a local editor.
    
    - The challenges are from Prepare > Algorithms > Warmup 

Mostly of the content probably is gonna have English and Portuguese mixed.

- The lonely-integer have one file with confusing things, is not teh response the I submit.

Trying to keep it shine **plim plim**.
